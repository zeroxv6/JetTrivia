# JetTrivia

JetTrivia is a trivia quiz application built using modern Android development tools and practices. It leverages Kotlin programming language and incorporates the following components:

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture**: A design pattern that separates the user interface (UI) code from the business logic, making the app more modular and easier to test.

- **Room Database**: A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, allowing for more robust database management within Android apps.

- **Jetpack Compose**: Android's modern toolkit for building native UI, which simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.

## Features

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Users can participate in trivia quizzes on various topics.

- **Local Data Storage**: Quiz data is stored locally using Room Database, enabling offline access and efficient data management.

- **Modern UI**: The app's interface is built with Jetpack Compose, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
